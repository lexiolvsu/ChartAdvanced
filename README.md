### TUTORIAL VIDEO COMING SOON
---
- Download the source code for ChartAdvanced.
- Grab the source code for whatever engine you're using, for example: Kade Engine.
- Insert the files of the source folder of ChartAdvanced in the source folder of your engine and replace the files, same thing with the WeekBG.png image.

- If you're making your own mod, put the background images into one file called WeekBG.png, if it has several, name it <FirstSong>BG.png for the first song, <SecondSong>BG.png for the second song, and <LastSong>.png for the last song, please note if the file is animated, just use the first frame.
- Sit back and relax as it compiles into an advanced charting engine.
